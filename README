Outline::Lua

With Outline::Lua you can string-eval Lua code.

Create a Lua object with Outline::Lua::new and register Perl functions
to it. The Perl functions become available to Lua as Lua functions.

Lua is meant as a safe environment for running user-contributed code, or
simply so you don't have to write your own domain-specific language for
your application.

You can find Lua at http://www.lua.org/

A sandbox is fine too!


PREREQUISITES

Outline::Lua should compile against Lua 5.0 and above. If it does not,
please file a bug (see below).

Note that under Ubuntu and possibly other distros, simply installing the
Lua dev packages will not work. No, I don't know why.

I recommend always building Lua from source. It is really easy. Even I managed it.

Lua can be found at http://www.lua.org/download.html
