Outline::Lua

With Outline::Lua you can string-eval Lua code.

Create a Lua object with Outline::Lua::new and register Perl functions
to it. The Perl functions become available to Lua as Lua functions.

Lua is meant as a safe environment for running user-contributed code, or
simply so you don't have to write your own domain-specific language for
your application.

You can find Lua at http://www.lua.org/

A sandbox is fine too!


PREREQUISITES

Outline::Lua is compiled against Lua 5.1, which seems to have been current for
long enough that I'm accepting it as an appropriate version to use.

Outline::Lua is developed on Ubuntu 10.04, which uses pkg-config to find its
compiler flags. If you don't have pkg-config set up with lua5.1 in it then you
will have to edit Makefile.PL yourself and add the correct flags in there.

Patches to make it work with 5.0 or 5.1 are welcomed.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

This will install the version you checked out. If you prefer, you can install it
from cpan:

    cpan Outline::Lua

but this method will not give you the bleeding-edge version.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

The best place to get the docs is from the module itself:

    perldoc Outline::Lua

If you think you've found a bug, please post it to the github issues page, of
course after checking that it is not already there.
