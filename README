Outline::Lua

With Outline::Lua you can string-eval Lua code.

Create a Lua object with Outline::Lua::new and register Perl functions
to it. The Perl functions become available to Lua as Lua functions.

Lua is meant as a safe environment for running user-contributed code, or
simply so you don't have to write your own domain-specific language for
your application.

You can find Lua at http://www.lua.org/

A sandbox is fine too!


PREREQUISITES

Outline::Lua has been written against Lua 5.1, the current. If it does not,
please do check that your Makefile.PL is pointing to the right libs. They are
currently correct for Ubuntu 10.04, if you install liblua5.1-0-dev.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

This will install the version you checked out. If you prefer, you can install it
from cpan:

    cpan Outline::Lua

but this method will not give you the bleeding-edge version.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

The best place to get the docs is from the module itself:

    perldoc Outline::Lua

If you think you've found a bug, please post it to the github issues page, of
course after checking that it is not already there.
