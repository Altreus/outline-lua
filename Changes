Revision history for Outline-Lua

0.10    2009-05-26
        Now you can register Perl variables with Lua. Not all types are supported; only:
          - numbers
          - booleans
          - strings
          - tables (arrayrefs and hashrefs)

        Func refs are to come; I can't think of a good way of doing objects fully yet but
        I have ideas.

0.03    2009-05-18
        The version info in the pm was wrong so the tests failed when installing from cpan.

0.02    Not long after
        The docs were wrong!

0.01    At some point
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
